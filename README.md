# Imagebook - Shopify 2021 developer challenge

Imagebook is a web platform that allows users to store and access their images securely and easily. Users can create accounts and start uploading images to the platform. They can choose to allow public access of private access to their images. Furthermore, an user can view other people's public images, but only an owner can delete his or her images. All images are stored persistently on a database. 


## Demo
